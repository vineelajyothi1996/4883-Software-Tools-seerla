I choose Atlassian JIRA and Confluence for my presentation as it is commonly used and popular in market. It helps me learn the tools and an advantage for career. It helps most of the teams work together and manage projects in workspaces. Its a combination of issue tracking and agile processes of JIRA with the knowledge sharing and documentation features of Confluence.
